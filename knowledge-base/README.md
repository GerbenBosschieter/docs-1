# Knowledge base
As there are alot of topics around our development of the Forus platform, this will be the primary place to write down all blogs, news articles that spread knowledge. This knowledge base will also contain guides that support users, developers or administrators.

## How can I help?
There are multiple ways you can help - even if you donâ€™t write code, you can still contribute. We are always looking for assistance with creating or updating documentation, testing our web, desktop and mobile apps, and reporting bugs.
